# Privacy Policy

I don't store your data, period.

I physically can't. I have nowhere to store it. I don't even have a server database to store it.
So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, I wouldn't have anything to show him.

That's why, with MÃ©lodie, what happens on your computer stays on your computer.
